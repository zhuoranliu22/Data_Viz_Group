        <h1>Understanding Gentrification in New York City</h1>

        <p>New York City has been a site of intense gentrification over the past several decades, 
          with many neighborhoods experiencing significant demographic and economic changes. Researching gentrification in New York can help us understand how gentrification impacts different communities, 
          how it is related to broader processes of urbanization and globalization, and how policymakers and activists can respond to the challenges it presents. It can also shed light on the intersections of race, class, and gender in the gentrification process, 
          and how power dynamics shape who benefits and who is left behind. </p>
